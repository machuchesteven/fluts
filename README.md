# This is a project for my Great flutter apps in the year 2023 - 2024

This project is aimed to make a master of flutter out of me in a year, a challenge which goes hand-in-hand with the [ui.ux_daily](https://instagram.com/ui.ux_daily) instgram account, and Machustudio section of mobile apps designs

My building time for each day of building is 120 minutes and each day of building means another repo
